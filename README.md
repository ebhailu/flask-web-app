# Secure Programming Learning GitHub Action Template for Python

This is a template repository for secure programming learning with
the help of CodeQL, a SAST tool.

In this assignment, I put into practice several Flask capabilities for website development, such as templates, error handling, URL handling, forms, etc. 
I designed a web application using Flask to process course override requests at VCU. 
This application allows students to submit an override request via a web form, and after successful submission, the application displays a confirmation message.


### Requirements
* A web form with the following fields:
  * Student Name (required)
  * Student ID (required)
  * Course Name (required)
  * Course Number (required)
  * Justification (not-required)
